<h1>Udhav Fowdar</h1>

<p>Hello there,
if you are reading this then you have found me!
</p>

<h2>Who I am</h2>
<p>As it says above my name is Udhav Fowdar and I am a recent graduate in
Mathematics from Univerity College London. My field of interest is mainly
topology and geometry. My Master's project titled "A
Functional Analytic Approach to Morse Homology" (which I
shall upload in the near future) was done under the supervision of
Dr Chris Wendl.
